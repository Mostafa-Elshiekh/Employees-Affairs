# Employees Affairs
## Finally, i finished **object oriented programming course (OOP) by using C++ .**
This project as  an application on the principles  which  i learned in this course , in short this project as **Employees Affairs** , which the Employees in this company They are divided into **two** types :
 * 1-Sellers 
 * 2-Engineers

each of them has its own specifications, both **attributes and methods** if we run the programe will Employee id for the Employee which you want to search about it,
number of allowed IDs from[100,105]..and programe will print every thing about this id , if you enter wrong id will print not found..and every once aske if you continue or you need break.

## The principles  which i applied in the project ðŸ‘€ 
* 1- Constructor & Destructor.
	 > To to initialize the attributes by default values and print a Welcome message and date and time.
*  2- The default Copy Constructor.
    >Take default values for attributes by user.
 * 3- Inheritance
   >To tack tow classes by Inheritance from base abstracted class.
  * 4-  Function Overriding.
    > To make any function in base class can i  make another function with same name in the  Inheritance class to use it and I add to her according to what suits her in this   class.
   * 5- Polymorphism , virtual and pure Functions.
      > Polymorphism : is an OOP concept that refers to ability a variable ,function or object to take on multiple forms by it i can make some functions with **same name and signature but difference implementation** it have 2 kind :
     > * 1-compile time Polymorphism ex(Method overloading) more function with same name but **difference signature** .
        >* 2-Run time Polymorphism  ex(Method overriding ) 
     **ex**:
```js
          int add(int num1,int num2)
          float add(float num1,float num2)
   ```
